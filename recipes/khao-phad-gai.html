     <h5>Khao Phat Gai or Thai Chicken Fried Rice is loaded with flavor and can be served Thai Hot with
          Prik Nam Pla, a spicy Thai fish sauce.</h5>

     <p>Fried rice is one of those meals that truly brings me back to my childhood. I loved eating it 
          as a kid, and it was a meal that my mom could make in a few minutes with leftover rice and 
          whatever protein she had on hand.</p>

     <p>Thai Fried Rice is also something my mom would always make for gatherings and parties, in 
          addition to her famous Thai Spring Rolls. I love that I get to pass down these recipes to my 
          kids.</p>
