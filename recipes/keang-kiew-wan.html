     <h5>Khao Phad Gai or Thai Chicken Fried Rice is loaded with flavor and can be served Thai Hot with
          Prik Nam Pla, a spicy Thai fish sauce.</h5>

     <p>Fried rice is one of those meals that truly brings me back to my childhood. I loved eating it 
          as a kid, and it was a meal that my mom could make in a few minutes with leftover rice and 
          whatever protein she had on hand.</p>

     <p>Thai Fried Rice is also something my mom would always make for gatherings and parties, in 
          addition to her famous Thai Spring Rolls. I love that I get to pass down these recipes to my 
          kids.</p>

          <li>¼ small onion, small diced</li>
          <li>Chili flakes, to taste</li>
          <li>2 leaves kale, stems thinly sliced on a bias, leaves cut into ribbons (keep stems and 
               leaves separated)</li>
          <li>2 Eggs</li>
          <li>350 g cooked jasmine rice (about 2 ¼ cup)</li>
          <li>¼ tsp ground white pepper</li>
          <li>Lime wedge</li>
          <li>⅓ cup chopped cilantro</li>
          
     </ul>

     <h2>Sauce</h2>

     <ul>
          <li>2 tsp soy sauce</li>
          <li>2 tsp fish sauce</li>
          <li>1/2 - 1 tsp black soy sauce</li>
          <li>1 1/2 tsp sugar</li>
     </ul>

     <h2>Instructions</h2>

     <ol>

          <li>Combine chicken with Golden Mountain Sauce and sugar; set aside.</li>

          <li>Heat a wok or a large sauté pan over medium high heat, add marinated chicken and let 
          brown on one side. Once browned, toss the chicken and cook until done. Remove from pan 
          and set aside.</li>

          <lip>In the same wok, add a little more oil to coat the bottom, and heat over medium high heat. 
          Add onion, garlic and chili flakes and sauté until the onion is translucent. Add kale 
          stems and stir for 1 minute.</li>

          <li>Add eggs, break the yolks, and let the egg set about half way then scramble briefly. Add 
          rice and toss briefly, breaking up big lumps with the back of your spatula.</li>

          <li>Add all sauce ingredients and toss, breaking up lumps, until the rice is evenly coated 
          in the sauce and the grains are all separated. Add more black soy sauce if you want a 
          darker color.</li>
          
          <li>Add kale leaves and white pepper and toss just to wilt the kale leaves. Add the chicken 
          back in, along with the juices collected in the bowl, and toss to mix until the rice 
          has absorbed all the chicken juices.</li>     
          
          <li>Serve immediately with a lime wedge and topped with chopped cilantro and cucumber.</li> 
     
</ol>
