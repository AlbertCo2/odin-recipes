     <p>Thai Curries are one of my favorite weeknight dishes to whip together when I'm craving a fast comforting 
        meal. The secret is to use a high quality curry paste to get those authentic flavors in a quick meal.</p>

     
     
     <h2>Ingredients</h2>

     <p>Here are ingredients you'll need for an authentic Thai green curry. The bamboo shoots are a common vegetable 
        used for green curry, but feel free to change it up.</p>

     <ul>
          <li>Thai basil</li>
          <li>Bamboo shoots, canned</li>
          <li>Red chillies</li>
          <li>Green curry paste, store bought or homemade</li>
          <li>Kaffir lime leaves</li>
          <li>Full fat coconot milk</li>
          <li>Fish sauce</li>
          <li>Palm sugar</li>
          <li>Boneless chicken</li>
          <li>Chicken stock, unsalted</li>

     </ul>
