     <h5>Pad Thai is an iconic Thai Noodle dish that has flavors of sweet, sour, and saltiness. I show 
        how to easily make your own sauce to create this dish at home.</h5>

     <p>Usually when someone is trying Thai food for the first time, they order Pad Thai. It's a safe 
        choice, you really can't go wrong with stir-fried rice noodles. Pad Thai has a popular trifecta 
        of flavors, sweet, salty, and a little sour from the tamarind (which is a key ingredient in 
        the sauce).</p>

     <p>Pad Thai can be intimidating to recreate at home, but I will list steps below along with a 
        full YouTube Video at the end of this post. I highly recommend watching the video before 
        making this dish. </p>
